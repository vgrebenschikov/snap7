Snap7, through three specialized components: Client and the inedited Server and Partner, 
allows you to definitively integrate your PC based systems into a PLC automation chain.
Designed to transfer large amounts of hi-speed data in industrial facilities, 
it scales easily, down to small Linux Arm boards such as Raspberry PI.

Hi level object oriented wrappers are provided, currently C/C++, .NET/Mono, Pascal, LabVIEW, 
Python with many source code examples.

Very easy to use, a full working server example is not bigger than the “Hello world”.
Many projects/makefiles are ready to run to easily rebuild Snap7 in any platform without the need of be a C++ guru.

Very detailed documentation provided.
